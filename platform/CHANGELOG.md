# Layer Platform API Change Log

## June 21, 2016

#### Enhancements

* Response objects have explicit `null` where before the attributes were simply absent.
* When making a request on behalf of a user (i.e. `/apps/:app_uuid/users/:user_id/...`), if that user _does not exist in our system yet_, you will get a `404` response with a clear error.  Prior to now, the user was always created in our system on the fly.

## February 24, 2016

#### Bug Fixes

#### Enhancements

* Add new user-specific conversation data access APIs.  These enable you to access one or all of a given user's conversations in the context of that user -- meaning additional attributes such as unread count, last message, etc.
