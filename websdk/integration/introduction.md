# Web SDK

The Layer Web SDK is Layer's Javascript API for accessing Layer Services.  Its built on top of Layer's [Client APIs](/docs/client) which provides REST and Websocket APIs.  Typical javascript applications will be far easier to build using the Layer Web SDK which manages authentication, connections, websocket retries, etc.


## Samples, Demos and Tutorials

Depending on whether you want to learn to use the WebSDK or just see what can be built with it, we have [Web SDK Tutorials](https://developer.layer.com/docs/websdk/tutorials) and [Web SDK Sample Apps](https://github.com/layerhq/layer-js-sampleapps).

### Tutorials

The [Web SDK Tutorials](https://developer.layer.com/docs/websdk/tutorials) are a good place to start if you want to quickly build your first app, see how the WebSDK helps to build that App, and understand concepts of using the WebSDK.

### Samples and Demos

The [Web SDK Sample Apps](https://github.com/layerhq/layer-js-sampleapps) repository is a good starting place for:

* Quickly test out the functionality of the Web SDK without needing to write code
* Experimenting and tinkering with Web SDK code to understand how it works
* Starting templates for some basic UI components

Examples are provided in:

* [React](https://github.com/layerhq/layer-js-sampleapps/blob/master/react)
* [Angular](https://github.com/layerhq/layer-js-sampleapps/blob/master/angular)
* [Backbone](https://github.com/layerhq/layer-js-sampleapps/blob/master/backbone)

React developers should take a look at our experimental [Flux-friendly component](https://github.com/layerhq/layer-js-sampleapps/tree/master/react/layer-react) and provide feedback via [Github Issues](https://github.com/layerhq/layer-js-sampleapps/issues).  Once we've gather more feedback from the React community we will review turning this into a separete NPM module.
